A C/C++ program that polls the current volume level, converts it to a color, and outputs it to certain keyboards and RGB LED strips via an Arduino. Originally created just to visualize music, but the program has many more modes now, including displaying solid colors when no music is playing and pulse control for individual color channels (this allows many different effects like breathing or rainbow color cycles to be created). This project had a strong focus on interfacing with hardware, low-level coding, and performance optimization.
