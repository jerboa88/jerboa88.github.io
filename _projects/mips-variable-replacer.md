A tool to simplify development in MIPS. This Python script is a sort of precompiler for MIPS that lets you use
custom register names in MIPS assembly. By running the script before you assemble, custom variable
names are mapped to real registers you specify. Created as an experiment to help debug my own MIPS
assignments in University
