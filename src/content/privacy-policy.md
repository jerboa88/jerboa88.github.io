This privacy notice describes how and why [johng.io](/) ("**we**", "**us**", "**our**") might collect, store, use, and/or share your information when you use our services ("**Services**") by:

- Visiting any page of our website at [johng.io](/)
- Visiting any website of ours that links to this privacy notice
- Communicating with us by email, social media, or any other means

By using our Services, you agree to our policies and practices as described in this document.


### What information do we collect?

#### User Provided Information

When communicating with us, you may be asked to provide certain personal information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personal information may include:

- Names (first name, last name, and/or nickname)
- Email addresses
- Other identifiable information included in contact form submissions

The personal information that we collect depends on the information you choose to provide. You are not required to provide a real name when contacting us. Our Services do not collect sensitive information.

#### Automatically Collected Information

##### User Preferences

We may use cookies, local storage, or similar technologies to store and access user preferences related to our Services. Cookies are stored locally on your machine and your preferences are not shared with other websites or sent to us. To opt-out of cookies, see [Disabling cookies](#disabling-cookies).

##### Logging & Analytics

Our Services use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for performance, security, and DNS services. Some DNS records are proxied through Cloudflare, meaning your connection is routed through their network.

When you connect to our Services, Cloudflare may log and store limited technical data related to your request, including:
- Country of origin
- Bandwidth usage
- Basic usage statistics (ex. number of requests)

We also use [Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) to gain further insight into how users interact with our Services. This includes anonymized data such as:
- Pages visited
- Referral source (ex. the website or link that brought you to our Services)
- Device type
- Browser type and version
- Operating system
- Screen size
- Country of origin
- Time of access

For users outside the European Union (EU), we also use Cloudflare Real User Measurements (RUM) to collect performance data when you use our Services, such as:
- Page load times
- Device and browser performance metrics
- Network characteristics

Your privacy is important to use, so we don't:
- use client-side state like cookies or local storage to collect usage metrics across page visits.
- track your interactions across different websites.
- "fingerprint" you using your IP address, User Agent, or other identifiers.
- sell or share your data with third parties.

The metrics above are presented to us in aggregated form only. There may be additional metrics collected and the exact ones collected are subject to change over time. See [the documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/data-metrics/) for more details on what information is collected by Cloudflare Web Analytics.


### How do we use your information?

If you provide us with personal information when you contact us, we use that information to respond to your inquiries, to offer support to you and other users, and to diagnose and debug issues with our Services.

Logs and analytics are used to monitor traffic trends, detect potential threats, and improve our Services.

Real User Measurements (RUM) help us understand how real users experience the speed and performance of our Services, and are used to monitor and improve the performance of our Services.


### When, and with whom do we share your information with?

Contact form submissions are processed by [Formspark](https://www.formspark.io/) and are subject to their data processing policies. Refer to their [privacy policy](https://www.formspark.io/legal/privacy-policy/) for more details.

Analytics and RUM are processed by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and are subject to their data processing policies. Refer to their [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for more details.

We may disclose your personal information:

- if disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or other legal request by public authorities
- for other purposes, with your consent

We do not sell or share your personal information with any other third-party services.

### How long do we keep your information?

We keep a record of all correspondence with users so that we:
- have a history of past correspondences to reference if you contact us again
- can diagnose and debug issues with our Services
- can plan, record, or account for user inquiries

If you'd like us to remove your personal information, see [Withdrawing consent](#withdrawing-consent).


### How do we protect your information?

We take steps to secure your personal information. For example, we aim to use the following security measures whenever possible:

- strong passwords
- MFA (multi-factor authentication)
- encryption during transit (TLS)
- encryption at rest
- limited access

Keep in mind that no method of electronic transit or storage is 100% secure. For this reason, we recommend that you limit the amount of personal information you provide when contacting us.

For logs and analytics, we rely on Cloudflare’s infrastructure, which adheres to modern security standards and best practices. We do not store analytics or performance data on our own servers.

### Do we collect information from minors?
