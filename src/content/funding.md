Find one of my projects useful? Sponsoring me will help me cover costs and **_commit_** more time to open-source.

If you don't want to donate, no worries. If you still want to contribute though, there are many other ways to help out, like:
- submitting feature requests
- submitting bug reports
- implementing features
- fixing bugs
- writing documentation
- writing translations
- spreading the word

I'll take all the help I can get ;)
