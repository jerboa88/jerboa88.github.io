	<h2>About</h2>

	<p>I am a passionate Computing Science student currently working towards my Bachelors Specialization at the University of Alberta. I am interested in a wide variety of compute related topics including programming, 2d/3d graphic design, audio production, and web design. I have experience with both web technologies and classical programming. I am most comfortable with vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python but I am always busy learning more!</p>
